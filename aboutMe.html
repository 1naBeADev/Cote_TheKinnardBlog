            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>Let me take a moment to introduce myself. I've always been someone who enjoys staying active, and basketball used to be my greatest passion. I was deeply involved in the game, and at one point, I could say I was almost obsessed with it. I spent every free moment either playing with friends or watching professional games to pick up new skills and strategies. For me, basketball was more than just a sport; it was a way to relax and bond with others.</p>

            <p>However, as time passed, I found myself getting into a different hobby: mobile gaming. I especially enjoy playing Mobile Legends, a game I can easily dive into whenever I have some downtime. It demands strategic thinking, teamwork, and quick reflexes, which keeps me engaged. Even when I’m not up for a full basketball game, you can catch me battling with my team in Mobile Legends, striving for that win.</p>

            <p>Right now, I’m a first-year college student at Mapúa University. My college experience is just starting, and it’s been both thrilling and challenging. Being part of Mapúa University is a significant honor for me because of its excellent reputation in engineering and technology. I feel like this is a place where I can develop both academically and personally, and I’m excited about what the future has in store.</p>

            <p>Alongside my studies, I've developed a keen interest in coding. I think it's amazing how programming languages and coding ideas can turn concepts into reality, whether it's creating an app, designing a website, or tackling tough problems. Even though I'm still in the learning phase, I've already taken on a few small projects and I'm excited to explore this field further. To me, coding feels like piecing together a puzzle—it's challenging but super satisfying.</p>

            <p>For some time, I also made it a priority to exercise regularly to maintain my physical health. I even thought about getting into bodybuilding because the idea of shaping my body and reaching a higher fitness level really appealed to me. I admired the discipline, consistency, and transformation that come with bodybuilding. Unfortunately, with my busy college and work schedule, I had to put that dream on hold for now.</p>

            <p>As a student who works, juggling my studies and a job is a daily challenge. I work as a Quality Assurance (QA) professional at a BPO company, which requires a lot of attention to detail and the ability to spot flaws in processes or products. This role has been a real eye-opener for me. Even though it can be demanding, it's fulfilling to know that my efforts contribute directly to the quality of the services my company provides.</p>

            <p>With everything going on in my life—college, work, basketball, gaming, and coding- I've realized that managing my time effectively is crucial to keeping up with it all. Balancing these activities can be really challenging, but I've figured out how to prioritize and stay focused. This balance is what drives me to keep moving forward each day, knowing that my hard work will open up more opportunities down the line.</p>

            <p>While basketball and fitness used to be my main interests, I've started to appreciate other hobbies, like coding, which I can dive into during my spare time. Mobile gaming has also become a significant part of my routine, helping me relax after long hours of studying and working. Still, I occasionally find myself thinking back to the days spent on the court, competing with friends and enjoying the thrill of a good game.
            </p>

            <p>Looking to the future, I'm really excited about the opportunities that await me in both my personal and professional life. As I continue my studies at Mapúa, I aim to broaden my knowledge and skills, particularly in coding and technology. One of my long-term aspirations is to combine my love for technology with my career, possibly in software development or game design someday. I truly believe that the best is yet to come.</p>

            <p>In the end, even with all the obstacles I encounter, I stay hopeful about what lies ahead. Whether it's rekindling my passion for basketball, revisiting my fitness ambitions, or delving deeper into coding, I'm committed to pushing forward and seizing every chance that comes my way.</p>
