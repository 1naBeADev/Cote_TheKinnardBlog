            <h2>Playing Basketball</h2>
            <p>Basketball has always been a significant part of my life, and I began playing when I was really young. It turned into more than just a sport for me; it became a true passion. By the time I reached high school, I was lucky enough to join the varsity team, which was one of my proudest achievements. Over the years, I developed a deep admiration for NBA players, especially Derrick Rose, who is my ultimate idol. He was the first NBA player whose signature shoes and jersey I got, a special gift from my mom that made it even more meaningful. I loved playing basketball and could easily lose track of time, feeling the excitement with every dribble, pass, and shot. Sadly, everything changed when the pandemic struck. My ability to play like I used to was greatly affected, and since then, I've struggled to regain my previous rhythm. Nevertheless, my passion for the game is still strong, and I hold onto the wonderful memories of my time on the court.</p>

            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <p>I've been passionate about video games since I was a kid. Whether it's on a PC or mobile, I've always been fascinated by the amazing worlds they create. This interest in gaming also sparked my curiosity about technology. When I was younger, I really wanted to play the same games my friends enjoyed, but my family couldn't afford a computer that could handle them. So, I spent countless hours watching gameplay videos on YouTube, living vicariously through other players. Now that I'm older, I'm lucky that my parents were able to get me a decent PC, and I've also upgraded it with my own savings. Gaming remains one of my top hobbies, and it's incredible to finally experience the games I always wanted to play.</p>

            <h2>Working out</h2>
            <p>I've always enjoyed working out, and as time went on, I became really interested in bodybuilding. The thought of getting stronger, improving my body, and challenging myself was super exciting. Unfortunately, with school and work taking up so much of my time, I had to put this hobby on hold for now. It's been tough to carve out time for bodybuilding, but I believe that in the future, when my schedule opens up, I'll get back to it. I can't wait for that day because I know it will be rewarding to keep going on my fitness journey and dive deeper into bodybuilding.</p>
